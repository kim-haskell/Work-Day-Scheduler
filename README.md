# Work-Day-Scheduler

This work day scheduler allows you to schedule in events throughout the work day hours of 9am to 5pm. The hours are color-coded to show you the current hour: gray is previous hours, red is the current hour, and green is the upcoming hour. Once you type something in the schedule and save it, you can refresh the page and the information will be saved through local storage.
